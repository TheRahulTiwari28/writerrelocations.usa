                <h1 class="text-warning">The perks of moving to India from USA and vice versa</h1> <br>
                <p class="paragraph">India is one of the most vibrant countries in the world, always buzzing with activity, and replete with the most amazing sights and sounds; the kind of which you would struggle to find anywhere else in this whole wide world. India is a melting pot of cultures, religions, languages, and lifestyles. For the outside world, this can either be exciting or it could get a bit overwhelming. Either way, the interest in India is undeniable. And the interest doesn't just stem from the idea of exploring a vibrant culture and a different lifestyle; there is another factor, arguably more important, that contributes to it - India is a highly lucrative market for new businesses. Given the country's vast population and the diversity in tastes and preferences, you'd find a market for your business in India. The evils of red tapism have also disappeared and doing business in India is a lot easier. And the costs of setting up a business and operating it are also lesser than in the United States. This has prompted some ambitious and foresighted US citizens to seriously consider the idea of moving to India from USA. Also, the cost of living in India is quite low when compared to that in the US, which is another factor that lends support to the thought of moving to India.
                <br> <br>
                For Indian expats who have settled in America, the lure of living in their motherland and the newfound strength in the Indian economy make the prospect of moving from US to India worth considering. Thanks to the business-friendly policies of the Indian government, setting up a business in India has ceased to be the hassle that it used to be a decade ago; a fact reflected in India's meteoric rise in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index in the last 5 years. As a consequence of these factors, and the low cost of living that has already been discussed, the idea of shipping household goods from USA to India and moving back to the land you come from has more merits than demerits.
                <br> <br>
                <h1 class="text-warning">Moving to USA from India</h1> <br>
                <p class="paragraph">
                The United States of America - the world's economic and financial capital and the centre of power - is a land of hope and opportunity. Every year millions of people from across the globe move to this country with the dream of making a better life for themselves and their family. And Indians are as motivated to achieve this dream as anyone else in the world. It is hence only natural that thousands of Indians migrate to the USA every year in pursuit of this very dream. However, you won't find success lying on a platter in America. This country rewards only those who work hard and have the courage to walk on a path few have taken before them. But if you are smart, enterprising, creative, and dedicated to your goal, then there is no other place in the world that will reward you like the USA would. The reward, though, comes at a cost. The cost of living in the USA is pretty high as compared to India. The purchasing power parity of 1 USD is approximately INR 17. The fast-paced American lifestyle of cities such as New York, Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, etc. could also take a toll on many, but if you have lived in India's metro cities then you should be able to adapt to it quite easily. Nevertheless, if you want to avoid such a lifestyle, then you could move to states such as Texas, New Orleans, or Florida; states that offer a tremendous scope for personal and professional growth and for leading a healthier lifestyle. So if you are among the hundreds of thousands of young Indian residents who possess these qualities, and could afford the high cost of living in the USA and adjust to a fast-paced lifestyle, then start enquiring about international moving companies quotes for moving to the USA!</p> <br>

                    <p>“Writer Relocations' service was exceptional from the beginning. We started communicating for the clearance of goods in Mumbai. very timely communication and showed up right when they said they would, and worked hard, never slowing down. Writer Relocations came on time and did their job. They were fast, friendly, and very careful with our items while unpacking the stuff. I give my thanks to Writer Relocations for their wonderful support and timely operations. Thanks for everything and I wish good luck for Writer Relocations' future...I will definitely use them next time I move. I would rate the overall experience with Writer Relocations as a 4.6 out of 5 based on the service that they have provided to me for clearing the material in India. All in all, a great experience.” Ramdas Chandani, Moved from USA to Mumbai.</p>
